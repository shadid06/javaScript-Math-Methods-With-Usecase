// The Math.trunc() method in returns the integer part of a number by removing its fractional digits.

// it does not round the number up/down to the nearest integer, but simply removes the digits after the decimal point.

// Real life: From 9.99, you just keep 9.

console.log(Math.trunc(9.99)); // 9

// Project Use Case: Truncate a float value for display without rounding.
