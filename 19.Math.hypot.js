// Math.hypot() – returns the square root of the sum of squares of a set of numbers.
//  Pythagorean theorem (a² + b² = c²)

// Real life: You walk 3 units right and 4 units up — how far are you from the start?

console.log(Math.hypot(3, 4)); // 5

// Project Use Case: Measure direct distance between 2 points.
